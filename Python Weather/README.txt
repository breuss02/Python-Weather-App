# Python Weather App

## Overview

Python Weather App is a simple command-line application that allows you to check the weather for a specific location. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather information.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, you need to make sure you have the following:

1. Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.

2. PyFiglet: To add a stylized header to the weather report, we use PyFiglet. You can install it using pip:

pip install pyfiglet

3. OpenWeatherMap API Key: You need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to access their weather data. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free account at OpenWeatherMap.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the app.py file to your local machine.

2. Open app.py in your favorite text editor or IDE.

3. Locate the following line in app.py:

4. Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

5. Save the file.

## Usage

To use the Python Weather App, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where app.py is located. Then, run the app using the standard python command:

python app.py


Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the location for which you want to check the weather. The app will then fetch and display the weather information for the specified location.
